# Echolodean - Craft Your Own Vibes

Echolodean is an avant-garde music player application that grants users the creative freedom to craft unique audio tracks from their favorite songs. It’s more than just a player—it’s an artistic tool that bridges the gap between the known and the unknown in music.

## Overview

Developed with Java and Spring Boot, Echolodean interacts with a sophisticated music generation API to breathe new life into familiar tunes. It’s designed for those who seek a personalized music listening experience, where they can not only generate but also save and manipulate tracks effortlessly.

## Goal

Our primary ambition with Echolodean is to transform how users engage with music. By enabling them to generate and modify audio tracks derived from beloved songs or albums, we’re catering to the audiophiles who love to dive deeper into the creative abyss of musical renditions.
